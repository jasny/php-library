Jasny skeleton library (PHP)
===

Super easy to create a new Jasny library.

_Note: It's really specific and will only properly work for our organization Jasny and only on Ubuntu. If you want to
use it, fork and modify init.sh._

Usage
---

    composer create-project jasny/library -s dev --remove-vcs LIBRARY_NAME
